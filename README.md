## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

*Responsiveness – I am learning to do mobile-first workflow as I am finding it easier when dealing with responsiveness, which I have struggled with in the past. 
*Flexbox – I am using this as a good time to re-enforce the things I have learnt about flex box. 
*SVG – I have never worked with svg images in css and this served as a good exercise to learn that. 


### Continued development

I am still working on naming classes. Would like to get more into custom, variables. I am still very new to this all so I have a lot to learn.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's SVG videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJSCl6XEdP8) - Just to understand the very basic, he is a brilliant teacher and I am using a lot of his video's and courses through my development journey
- [Artical on using SVG as background images](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/how-to-add-svgs-with-css-background-image/) - This artical was instrumental in helping me use SVG images as background images.
